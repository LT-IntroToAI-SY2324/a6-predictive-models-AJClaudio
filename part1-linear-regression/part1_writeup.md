# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?

the r squared value is the correlation, the closer they are to one the more similar thw two would be.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?

137.46185286

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

i think they are pretty accurate because of the amount of data that was in blood pressure data is enough to see if the relations are constant.
