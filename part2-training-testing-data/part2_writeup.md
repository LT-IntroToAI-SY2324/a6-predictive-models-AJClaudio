# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

the model is more effective because training data allows to learn different patterns  that lets testing data to test and predict values for data that is left unseen

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

the higher the r squared value coefficient te better the correlation there is between the two tested data

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

I would say it isnt accurate because some of the r squared values go as low as 0.5 while others couldbe 0.7 which shows the wide range some of the data might be
