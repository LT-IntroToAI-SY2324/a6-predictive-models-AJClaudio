# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?

the r quared value is .85 which shows a strong connection between age, amount of miles on a car, and price.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?

yes the model is accurate because the price range that it is predicting is pretty good even though there are soe anomalies that are either way less or more expensive than 500.

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?

the model predicts the 10 yo car worth to be 9,273.66 dolars. if we do the 20 yo car it predicts to be 2442.09 dollars

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?

this may be because of instead of being an exponential model it is linear, so it is able to go into the negatives instead of having an aysmptote of a base price.
